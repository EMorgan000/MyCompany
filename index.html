    <h1>Welcome to Chico's!</h1>
    <p>
      Chico's has been the number 1 Mexican restaurant in the state of Missouri.
      After 25 years of service, and over a million customers served, we strive to continue
      providing the best tacos, burritos, and quesadillas for many years to come.
      Other than what we provide from our kitchens, we also belive in an excellent restaurant
      environment where friends and family can meet and make everlasting memories.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Back in 1996, a group of talented cooks, including Chico, were fresh
      out of college and wanted to put their skills to the test. They decided
      to pool their remaining funds and talents and open a restaurant in the
      downtown Springfield area. They were able to afford a small brick building
      with a modest sized kitchen and got to work immediately; branching out to
      other Mexican restaurants for ideas and pinning up posters downtown to gain
      extra skills and recognition. After just a few years of hard work and
      perseverance, Chico's went from just another Mexican restaurant into
      the amazing place it is today.
